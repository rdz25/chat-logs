Facebook chat log (html files) load and analysis. Facebook allows you to download a zip of all your chat logs as html files. The Jupyter notebook goes through my attempts to load the logs into a pandas' DataFrame and perform analysis on it. It's quick, it's tailored, and it's just for fun.

Chat logs not included in this repository for obvious reasons. The code and it's output should still be displayed in the notebook file. 
Aside from installing Jupyter Notebook, there's a web viewer here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
